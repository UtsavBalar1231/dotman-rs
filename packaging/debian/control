Description: blazingly fast dotfiles manager with git-like semantics
 dotman is a high-performance dotfiles manager designed for developers who
 demand speed without sacrificing functionality. Unlike traditional dotfile
 managers that treat performance as an afterthought, dotman is built from
 the ground up with extreme optimization in mind.
 .
 Key features:
  * SIMD-accelerated operations for string matching and UTF-8 validation
  * Parallel file processing using all available CPU cores
  * Memory-mapped I/O for efficient large file handling
  * xxHash3 for ultra-fast file hashing (>1GB/s throughput)
  * Sub-millisecond operations for typical dotfile repositories
  * Content-based deduplication to minimize storage usage
  * Zstd compression with dictionary training for optimal compression ratios
  * Binary index format for instant loading (10,000+ files in <10ms)
  * Git-like interface with familiar commands
  * Cross-platform support with architecture-specific optimizations
 .
 This package provides the 'dot' command-line tool for managing dotfiles
 with unprecedented performance and reliability.
